lets visit the website 
![[Pasted image 20250916102500.png]]
this is a hint to use the codename as user-agent ,since it is from R we can assume that each use a letter as codename lets try to chnage the letters when i tried A and B nothing happened but when i tried C it got redirected 
to do this i used burpsuite 
![[Pasted image 20250916102752.png]]
in burpsuite proxy turn on intercept and visit webpage 
![[Pasted image 20250916102922.png]]
here change the user-agent to C and forward you can then turn off intercept going to browser you will be in a different web page 
![[Pasted image 20250916103151.png]]
so from this the agent with codename C is chris and his password is weak
lets brute force it since in tryhackme asks for ftp password lets do ftp brute force using hydra
```

now we have downloaded 3 files from ftp 
lets see what is in it
```
cat To_agentJ.txt    
Dear agent J,  
  
All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your logi  
n password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.  
  
From,  
Agent C
```
hmm the password is stored in the pictures stenography or something...

in tryhack it asks for zip password so there is a zip file hidden some where 
i suspect the images might hide them 
lets use binwalk to extract it 
```
binwalk -e cutie.png

my intuition was right it is hidden in a image lets  crack the pass word using john

lets see what is inside the zip 
after extracting with password we found a txt file named 
![[Pasted image 20250916111312.png]]
what is this "QXJlYTUx"?
since tryhackme ask for steg password lets run stegcracker on cute_alien.png
